###  Original Forked Project
Soon this site's scope is heading in a different direction from the original work.
I still would like to give credit to the original authors that helped create it,
you can find the original upstream here: 
[nextjs-portfolio-starter](https://github.com/vercel/nextjs-portfolio-starter). 
Please check out their work.
