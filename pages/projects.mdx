# Projects

Here's some projects I have been involved with over the years that I can share with you. A lot was done during my time at the Center of Excellence in Wireless and Information Technology (CEWIT) at Stony Brook University. As I come across things I'll update this randomly.

SBU Brook University Smart Transit was the Stony Brook University student developed passenger information system for SBU Transit. SBU Smart Transit was developed through a partnership between the Stony Brook University Department of Transportation and Parking Operations, the Center of Excellence in Wireless and Information Technology (CEWIT) and the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences and was a comprehensive bus and shuttle global positioning system that provides live vehicle location, bus stop information, and estimated arrival times to passengers using web and mobile-based applications.

_On July 13, 2010, Stony Brook University received a $1.4 million National Science Foundation grant to build the "Reality Deck," an Immersive Giga-pixel Display in a 40' x 30' x 11' high room in Stony Brook University's Center of Excellence in Wireless and Information Technology (CEWIT) containing 308 LCD display screens driven by an 85-node graphics computing cluster._

I assisted with installation of hardware for a brief moment as an undergrad ad SBU.  Just a cool piece of tech to be a part of.
