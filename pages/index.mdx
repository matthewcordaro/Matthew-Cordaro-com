# Matthew Cordaro

Hey, I'm Matthew Cordaro, a software guy  with a passion for hardware and all things tech. Whether I'm writing code, working on a random hardware project, or diving into the latest video games, I'm always exploring new ways to challenge myself and innovate.

Beyond the screen, I enjoy spending quality time with my amazing wife, Liz, and our furry pal, Scotty, who bring endless joy and mischief into my life. From epic game nights to spontaneous DIY projects, we're a team that's always up for an adventure. And letâ€™s not forget a bowling night or two.

Feel free to reach out if you share my enthusiasm for tech, gaming, or just want to chat about the latest trends in
the industry.
